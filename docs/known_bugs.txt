Known bugs:
* call failover and call rerouting fail when the new call destination is using H.460.18
* H.245 sockets are bound to all interfaces (0.0.0.0), Home config option is ignored
  which may cause problems on multihomed hosts (virtual servers)
* authentication/accounting modules do not work well for gatekeeper forwarded 
  calls (ForwardOnFacility=1), it is recommended to disable this flag
* on FreeBSD systems using PTLib 2.11.0 long-form commandline arguments don't work
  use short form instead (eg. -S instead of --strict)
